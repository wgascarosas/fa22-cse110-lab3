        <h4>Agenda</h4>
        <p>
            In this meeting we covered the details involving the first project. 
            For the first project we brainstormed some potential ideas, narrowing our focus 
            down to a new social media application. This new social media app would take
            a picture of you (selfie) in real time as well as a picture of whatever is behind
            your back facing camera. Each day a notifcation would be sent out to remind users
            to take their time sensitive photo. The idea is to capture the real activities one
            may do on a day to day basis. Essentially to connect with others on a more "real" 
            level versus a surface level one that msot other social media apps are used for. 
        </p>
        <h4>Unfinished</h4>
        <p>
            We did not finish talking about whether we want this app to be only for mobile phones
            or tablets as well that have both front and back facing cameras.
        </p>
        <h4>New business - next meeting</h4>
        <p>
            We only discussed the idea of the project, we need to still figure out our approach
            to implementing this new idea. We will talk about the software involving it and which
            teams will be incharge of what next meeting.
        </p>
